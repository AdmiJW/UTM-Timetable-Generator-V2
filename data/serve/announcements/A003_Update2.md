> # Update: 2022/2023 Semester 1 1️⃣

<br>

26th September 2022

<br>

**👉 The timetable has been updated to reflect 2022/2023 Semester 1.**

<br>

**👉 Now you are able to display venue of your classes on the timetable!**

<br>

**👉 Don't know where your classes are? Open the venue page through the button at upper right corner**

<br>

Considering that classes are now physical, it is useful to have class location drawn on the timetable. This update
implements exactly that!

<br>

I had to manually key in each and every course from the excel timetable provided by school of computing before. Now that I have written a script to help me parse it, hopefully I am able to update faster next time
