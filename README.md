# ðŸ“… UTM Timetable Generator V2 ðŸ“…

### - [__Application Link HERE__](https://admijw.github.io/UTM-Timetable-Generator-V2/) -

Timetable Generator specifically for UTM students. The sequel of the previous [Timetable Generator](https://github.com/AdmiJW/UTM_Timetable_Generator) but now back stronger. Students from other universities are able to use this timetable generator if they don't mind filling in their courses manually.

## Dependencies:

* Modern [React](https://reactjs.org/). Unlike previous generator, this time no `class` components, only `function` components with `hooks`.
* Modern [Redux](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) using Redux toolkit. Writing in pure redux (previous project) is quite painful.
* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - css

Other dependencies:

* [KonvaJS](https://konvajs.org/) - Main library used to draw the timetable. Great for drawing on HTML Canvas
* [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown) - React and markdown.

## Project Structure

* `components` - React components. May be further broken down into Routes.
* `logic` - Contains logic code. For example, clash checking, timetable drawing using `Konva`
* `redux` - Redux (Toolkit). Contains the redux store, and `slices` of redux state.
* `styles` - SASS stylesheets. The `main.css` generated is used in the application.
