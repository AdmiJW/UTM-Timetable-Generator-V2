> # Update: 2022/2023 Semester 1 1️⃣

<br>

26th September 2022

<br>

**The timetable has been updated to reflect 2022/2023 Semester 1.**

<br>

I had to manually key in each and every course from the excel timetable provided by school of computing before. Now that I have written a script to help me parse it, hopefully I am able to update faster next time.
