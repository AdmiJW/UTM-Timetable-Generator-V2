If you had added some courses into the cart from the previous step, you'll see them again in this page.

<br />

This time, the courses will have the available sections listed out, along with *lecturer's name* and *class times*. Select the section that you belong by clicking the __Enroll__ button, and it will be added to the __Setup Page__ (Explained in Page 4).

<br/>

To remove a course from the cart, click on the __Trash bin__ button.
